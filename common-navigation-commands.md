Here's a quick list of the most common vi and vim editor navigation commands I use every day.

Moving on the current line

Here are the most common navigation commands for moving around the current line:

    0              Move to the beginning of the current line
    $              Move to the end of the current line
    5[RightArrow]  Move to the right 5 spaces
    5[LeftArrow]   Move to the left 5 spaces

Moving around the current screen
--------------------------------

Here are the most common navigation commands for moving around the current screen:

    H              Move to the first line on the screen
    M              Move to the middle line of the screen
    L              Move to the last line of the screen

    w              Move to the beginning of the next word
    b              Move backwards to the beginning of the previous word

    5[RightArrow]  Move to the right 5 spaces
    5[LeftArrow]   Move to the left 5 spaces<
    9[UpArrow]     Move up 9 lines
    7[DownArrow]   Move down 7 lines

Moving around the file
----------------------

Finally, here are the most common navigation commands for moving around the overall file:

    1G             Move to the first line of the file
    G              Move to the last line of the file
    31G            Move to the 31st line of the file

    [Ctrl]f        Move forward one screen
    [Ctrl]d        Move forward one-half screen
    [Ctrl]b        Move backward one screen
    [Ctrl]u        Move backward one-half screen

Of course there are a zillion other vi/vim navigation commands, but on a daily basis, these are the ones I use.
